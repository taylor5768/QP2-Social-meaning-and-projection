# QP2-Social-meaning-and-projection

This repository contains the stimuli for the experiments reported in this paper: http://www.journals.linguisticsociety.org/proceedings/index.php/PLSA/article/view/  

**QP2Stim-Main-Expanded.csv**: Stimuli for the main experiment reported in the paper.  

Target sentences in the main experiment featured a third-person matrix subject (e.g.,_Ben_), a clause-embedding predicate (e.g., _know, believe_), and a clausal complement (e.g., _Obama improved the American economy_).  The predicate and complement were embedded under negation (e.g., _John doesn't know that Obama improved the American economy_). Participants were asked whether a Democrat- or Republican-affiliated speaker who uttered the target sentence is certain that the content of the complement is true.  

Each row in the file represents a single target sentence.
-** Predicate:** the emebedding predicate
- **Complement:** the lexical content used to instantiate the clausal complement.
- **Orientation:** the political orientation of the lexical content (R= right, L=left, N=neutral)
- **Topic:** the topic that the lexical content is associated with. R/L lexical contents are paired such that there is a R and L lexical content corresponding to the same political topic. Each neutral lexical content is associated with a single topic. 
- **Block1.Speaker/Block2.Speaker, Block1.SpeakerGender/Block2.SpeakerGender**: the names and (stereotypical) genders of the speakers used in the two blocks, i.e., the Block1.speaker name was used in one block of the experiment for a given participant, and the Block2.speaker name was used in the other block* 
- **Block1.Subject/Block2.Subject, Block1.SubjectGender/Block2.SubjectGender**: the names and (stereotypical) genders for the third-person matrix subjects used in the two blocks, i.e., the Block1.subject name was used in one block of the experiment for a given participant, and the Block2.subject name was used in the other block*

**QP2Stim-Stim-Norming.csv**: Stimuli for the norming experiment.

Results from the norming experiment were used to select lexical contents for the main experiment. Target sentences featured lexical contents presented as main clauses (e.g., _Obama improved the American economy_), and participants were asked how likely a Democrat- or Republican-affiliated person would be to agree with that statement. 

Each row in the file represents a single target sentence:
- **Content:** the lexical content, presented to participants as a main clause. 
- **Orientation:** the political orientation of the lexical content (R= right, L=left)
- **Topic:** the topic that the lexical content is associated with. Lexical contents are paired such that there is a R and L lexical content corresponding to the same political topic.
